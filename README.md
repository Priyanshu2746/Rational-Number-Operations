# Rational-Number-Operations

This Java application performs basic arithmetic and comparison operations on rational numbers.

## Description

A rational number is a number in the form of a/b, where `a` and `b` are integers and `b != 0`. This program accepts two rational numbers from the user and performs the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Comparison
- Conversion to floating point

The program is written in an object-oriented style and uses exception handling to ensure robust operation.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two rational numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second rational number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two rational numbers.
- **Comparison**: Compares two rational numbers to check if they are equal.
- **Conversion to Float**: Converts a rational number to its floating-point representation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rational-Number-Operations.git
    ```
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac RationalNumber.java Main.java
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## Example

Here is an example of how the program works:

1. Input two rational numbers (e.g., 3/4 and 5/6).
2. The program will output the results of the addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, and float conversion operations.
